# Calling All \#GirlBosses: The Yellow Conference Is Back

\#GirlBoss(es) rejoice, The Yellow Conference returns to DTLA's Think Tank Gallery on Augusts 27th -- 28th! The Yellow Conference is an opportunity for creative and entrepreneurial women to gather, form connections, and inspire one another through the common goal of "bring(ing) goodness to the world through everyday living."

The conference was created for and by women in the hopes of empowering women to tap into their inner power in order to create change in their own lives and the world. The conference seeks to do this by connecting women around the world who are making a difference.

_"Our desire is to help you live a life filled with passion, one you are proud of. To fight for goodness, fight for love, and spread it throughout the world. Come to discover more about yourself, and how to use your uniqueness to live inspired and passionately throughout your days."_

The two-day conference features an abundance of [speakers and workshops][0] built around the four core elements of TYC: passion, inspiration, creativity, and truth.

The mission of The Yellow Conference: _"The Yellow Conference is a gathering for creative women who desire to ignite passion and bring goodness to the world through everyday living."_

_Yellow also holds monthly [Bloom Gatherings][1] around Los Angeles. _Get more information on The Yellow Conference **[here.][2]**
