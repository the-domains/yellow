## _A NOTE FROM OUR FOUNDER..._

The Yellow Conference was an idea that came to me in the shower -- a place where our brains can finally slow down for a moment, allowing us to pay attention to our ideas. I was in a creatively stunted place. I was burnt out on competing with and comparing myself to women around me. I needed a change.

Through various circumstances, I randomly met some women who were working hard, running businesses and doing it not to compete with others, not to get rich, not to blow up on social media, but to make an impact on the world around them for the better.

I was so inspired. I wanted more people like that in my life. I wanted to hear from these purposeful, do good entrepreneurs. I wanted to hear why they do what they do, how they got to where they are. I wanted to hear their stories and learn. Essentially, I wanted to sit in the audience of a conference.

2016 is our third conference, we have just about doubled in size every year, and the women who have come alongside our vision are the most passionate, creative and genuine women I've ever met.

_**One question everyone always asks me is, why YELLOW? Why did you name it that?**_

When I was thinking about what I wanted this conference to be, I started thinking how I wanted to encourage women to be like bees. Bees are hardworking, they live and work in community, they do nothing but what they were created to do. And in doing what they were created to do, they make flowers bloom, plants grow and give us fruit to eat. They make the world a more beautiful and nourished place.

They don't even realize the impact they are having on the world, because they are just being themselves. This is what I wanted to encourage our attendees to do. Be themselves, work hard, and see the blooms spread. Bees are yellow! Also, being a graphic designer, I loved the idea because I could see the entire brand in my head. Everything yellow. I knew it would stand out, it's happy, positive and bright. Everything fell together! Aaaand the domain name was available. Always a good sign.

Thanks for hanging around this little space of the internet. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

xoxo,
